Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: "Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care" described as "To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care."
    /// The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent.  This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.
