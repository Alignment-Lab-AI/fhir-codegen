    # A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
    # Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally computable sense.

The language tag on the resource may be used to specify the language of other presentations generated from the data in the resource. Not all the content has to be in the base language. The Resource.language should not be assumed to apply to the narrative automatically. If a language is specified, it should it also be specified on the div element in the html (see rules in HTML5 for information about the relationship between xml:lang and the html lang attribute).

Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
    # Contained resources do not have narrative. Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative. In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data (as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied).  This may be necessary for data from legacy systems where information is captured as a "text blob" or where text is additionally entered raw or narrated and encoded information is added later.

As described in the coding datatype: "A coding may be marked as a "userSelected" if a user selected the particular coded value in a user interface (e.g. the user selects an item in a pick-list). If a user selected coding exists, it is the preferred choice for performing translations etc. Other codes can only be literal translations to alternative code systems, or codes at a lower level of granularity (e.g. a generic code for a vendor-specific primary one).

    # A code to indicate if the medication is in active use.
    # This status is intended to identify if the medication in a local system is in active use within a drug database or inventory.  For example, a pharmacy system may create a new drug file record for a compounded product "ABC Hospital Special Cream" with an active status.  At some point in the future, it may be determined that the drug record was created with an error and the status is changed to "entered in error".   This status is not intended to specify if a medication is part of a particular formulary.  It is possible that the drug record may be referenced by multiple formularies or catalogues and each of those entries would have a separate status.
